# Changelog

All updates and improvements to the Lemon app will be documented here.

## [Version 1.1.0] - September 2024

This is our first major feature release focused on improving tracking details and user experience.

### ✨ New Features

- **Sub-Categories**: You can now add sub-categories for each transaction, providing deeper insights into your spending and income. Simply select a main category, and a panel will appear to choose a sub-category.
- **Transaction Location/Store**: Add a location or store name as an optional field when creating a transaction to remember where you made the purchase.
- **Updated Category Structure**: We've revamped and added several new, more relevant categories for digital workers and freelancers, such as "Subscriptions" (for software, cloud, etc.) and "Side Hustle" as a primary income category.

### 🎨 Enhancements & Fixes

- **UI Consistency**: The transaction history is now always grouped by date (`Today`, `Yesterday`, etc.) across all sections of the app for a more consistent experience.
- **Cleaner Layout**: Long category names in the transaction form will now be truncated with an ellipsis (...) to keep the layout clean.
- **Homepage Background**: The homepage now uses a light gray background (`bg-muted`) to be uniform with other pages.
- **Simplified Header**: The duplicate "Settings" button in the homepage header has been removed to simplify navigation.
